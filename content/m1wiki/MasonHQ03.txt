Revamping and wikifying the Mason HQ site in 2003.

Summary: I want the site to be mostly wiki, but retain certain pages (or parts of pages) as dynamically generated and/or centrally controlled. My main goals are to

0 Tear down whatever barriers remain to user contributions.
0 Eliminate the current over-engineered content management system.
0 Reduce to an absolute minimum the amount of site content that must be maintained by the site administrators (i.e. myself and DaveRolsky).

Topics about the redesign:

* MasonHQ03AccountsAndLogins
* MasonHQ03ConvertingCurrentPages
* MasonHQ03WikiCategorySupport
* MasonHQ03WikiComponentCalls
* MasonHQ03WikiFeatures
