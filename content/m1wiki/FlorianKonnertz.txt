Hello!
 
I am a newbie to Mason, came in contact with it when installing the musicbrainz.org server and database.

I've been using mostly python and zope the last years but am frustrated of a memory problem of my private zope so I'm looking for a new CMS related web technology. Could it be Mason...?
