My Mason packages are [here  http://ftp.kspei.com/pub/kspei/add-ons/redhat/].  At the moment I have old packages for Red Hat 7.3 and current ones for Red Hat 8.0 and 9.  See MasonAndFedora for packages for Fedora Core 1.



The easiest way to install the packages is to use apt, which can be found [here http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/redhat/9/apt/].  Install [apt-0.5.5cnc6-fr1.i386.rpm http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/redhat/9/apt/apt-0.5.5cnc6-fr1.i386.rpm] or whatever is newest, then edit [=/etc/apt/sources.list] and add the following:

    rpm http://ftp.kspei.com/pub/apt redhat/9/en/i386 kspei

Then just run [=apt-get update && apt-get install perl-HTML-Mason].  Edit [=/etc/httpd/conf.d/perl-HTML-Mason.conf] appropriately and [=service httpd restart], and you should have a working installation.

Be aware that other people are saying this combination is broken (see ApacheModPerl2), but it seems to work well enough for me, using it lightly.

These instructions worked fine for me. I ran into a few glitches with Apache:DBI at first but it was easily resolved. Thanks again.
