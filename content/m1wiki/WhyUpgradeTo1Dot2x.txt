Why should you upgrade from 1.05 to 1.2x? Besides the warm fuzzy feeling of being on a release that's actually supported, here's a list of the important features and bug fixes.

* Source-file line numbers in error messages

* [http://www.masonhq.com/docs/manual/Devel.html#component_calls_with_content Component calls with content] (<&| &> syntax)

* Ability to use print or $r->print to send output

* Built-in [redirect http://www.masonhq.com/docs/manual/Devel.html#external_redirects] method

* [http://www.masonhq.com/docs/manual/Devel.html#subrequests Subrequests]

* An overhauled class hierarchy designed for [http://www.masonhq.com/docs/manual/Subclassing.html subclassing]

* A built-in [http://www.masonhq.com/docs/manual/CGIHandler.html CGI handler]

* Compatibility with Apache/mod_perl 2.0 (at a basic level - see ApacheModPerl2).

* Compatibility with the OreillyBook.

See http://www.masonhq.com/code/history.html, all the way back to 1.09_01, for a comprehensive list of changes.

*How hard is it to upgrade?*

Most of the incompatible changes between 1.0x and 1.2x involve installation and configuration - generally the kind of work can happen in a single place behind the scenes. The few incompatible syntax changes involve deprecating old or hopelessly buggy syntax. See the [http://masonhq.com/docs/upgrading.html upgrade guide] for the comprehensive list, and note how small the "Syntax" section is. The vast majority of components should work without changes, especially if you use the backward compatibility cache mode.

Would there be any performance-related reasons?

No, in fact 1.2x was slightly slower...but upgrading to 1.3x, which will be out very shortly, will give all the benefits of 1.2x plus performance enhancements.
