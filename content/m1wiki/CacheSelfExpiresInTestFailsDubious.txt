I just tried to install HTML::Mason using the CPAN script, like this:

$ perl -MCPAN -e shell
> install HTML::Mason

and I got this error during 'make test':

t/10-cache....................ok 4/20                                        
#   Failed test 'cache_self_expires_in'
#   in /Users/jonathan/.cpan/build/HTML-Mason-1.3101/blib/lib/HTML/Mason/Tests.pm at line 595.
t/10-cache....................ok 20/20# Looks like you failed 1 test of 20.  
t/10-cache....................dubious                                        
        Test returned status 1 (wstat 256, 0x100)
DIED. FAILED test 5
        Failed 1/20 tests, 95.00% okay

and I fixed it by changing the cache_self_expires_in test in t/10-cache.t to return 1 instead of nothing if the $m->cache_self call returns a true value.

So this:

return if $m->cache_self( expires_in => '1s' );

Became this:

return 1 if $m->cache_self( expires_in => '1s' );

and with that change the test passed.

I'm pretty sure HTML::Mason is working as intended so I think this was just a mistake in the test script.

Cheers,
Jonathan
