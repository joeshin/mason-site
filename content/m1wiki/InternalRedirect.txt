If you're having problems with internal_redirect under Apache2 then you should use Apache2::SubRequest instead of Apache2::Request at the top of your handler. You should also load Apache2::Request before it to save on memory usage. See [http://search.cpan.org/~gozer/mod_perl-2.0.1/docs/api/Apache2/SubRequest.pod CPAN] for more details

* Can't locate object method "internal_redirect" via package "Apache2::RequestRec" at /data/sites/pwyt2/mason/handler.pl line 152.
