To set a global variable in httpd.conf 
add this line:

 PerlSetVar MasonAllowGlobals $varname

The result is, that you can use the variable 
in every component without declaring it.

If you want to have more than one global, then
add the following after the above line:

 PerlAddVar MasonAllowGlobals $othervarname

Then you can get more than one.

When you are setting or adding variables in the Apache  configuration file, remember you're not in Perl. If you add a semi-colon (*;*) you'll cause a parse error.
