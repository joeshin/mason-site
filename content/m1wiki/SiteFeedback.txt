Marvelous work, Jonathan! Thanks!

I guess there's no "watch this page" function, but I'll use another app to do that for the pages I want to monitor for changes: Website-Watcher ( http://www.aignes.com/ ). Plus the "Recent Changes" menu item looks good. -- DaveBaker

* I was thinking about a "watch this page" function. Do you have an example of a wiki that does this? How does it work - does it email on every change (that seems excessive), or limit emails to a certain time period? aignes.com looks cool though! -- JonathanSwartz
