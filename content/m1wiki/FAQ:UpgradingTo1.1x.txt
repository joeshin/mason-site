[&TOC FAQ:UpgradingTo1.1x]

=== After upgrading, I see this error whenever I load a page: "The following parameter was passed in the call to HTML::Mason::Component::FileBased->new() but was not listed in the validation options: create_time" ===
Delete all of your object files.

=== When I try to start my server I see an error like: "The resolver class your Interp object uses does not implement the apache_request_to_comp_path' method. ===
This means that ApacheHandler cannot resolve requests.

Are you using a handler.pl file created before version 1.10?  Please see the handler.pl sample that comes with the latest version of Mason.

You are explicitly creating an Interp object in your handler.pl and then passing that to ApacheHandler->new. 

Instead, simply pass all of your Interp parameters to ApacheHandler->new directly. The parameters will end up going where they belong. See the upgrade guide - http://masonhq.com/docs/upgrading.html - for more details.

=== When I start Apache (or try to use Mason) I get an error like this: "The Parser module is no longer a part of HTML::Mason.  Please see the Lexer and Compiler modules, its replacements." ===
The Parser module is no longer used. See the upgrade guide -- http://masonhq.com/docs/upgrading.html -- for more details.

=== I get an error like: "The following parameters were passed in the call to HTML::Mason::Container::new but were not listed in the validation options: error_format error_mode request_class resolver_class" when using ApacheHandler ===
Do you have PerlFreshRestart turned on? Turn it off.

See http://perl.apache.org/docs/1.0/guide/troubleshooting.html - "Evil things might happen when using PerlFreshRestart".

=== I get an error like this: 'Can't locate object method "make_ah" via
package "Apache"' ===
We're not kidding. PerlFreshRestart is evil. Turn it off. See question above.

=== I get: "Unknown config item 'comp_root'" or "Unknown config item 'comp_root'" or something similar with ApacheHandler. ===
Turn PerlFreshRestart off. Really.

=== I get this with a custom handler.pl: 'Can't call method "handle_request" on an undefined value at ...' ===
Just in case you weren't convinced that PerlFreshRestart is a bad idea, this should help convince you.

=== After upgrading, I get this error for all my components: '<%' without matching '%>' ... ===
The "perl_' prefix for Mason tags, like <%perl_args>, is no longer supported. Remove this prefix.
