There are several mailing lists for Mason now. If you are just starting out, 
we recommend the mason-users list, which is most general and most suited 
to new users. Browse through the archives to get a feel for the list 
before posting.

All lists are hosted at sourceforge and archived at MARC, among other
places. Thanks to Hank Leininger and others for an excellent archive
interface.

NNTP versions of these mailing lists are available at Gmane, thanks to
Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen.
