Welcome, gentle reader.

The files you find here are an exercise in learning Ajax, in an
HTML::Mason environment. I thought I would try to make it a
little easier for others who find themselves in my situation,
namely staring at the HTML::Prototype POD documentation, and
wondering: Now what do I do? 
 

You can run the examples from my [www site http://maztravel.com/ajax/] or you can [download them http://maztravel.com/perl/Mason/Ajax-Mason-Examples.tgz]
and install them on your own server. This is probably the preferred method, especially if you want to tinker with them.
