Since mid-2002, Mason has been Amazon.com's official website templating system, powering the main Amazon.com site as well as partner sites. As one engineer at Amazon writes, "Mason elegantly solves the problem of large-scale web development, giving Amazon.com web developers the power of industry-standard Perl and the simplicity of re-usable components. This has made it easy to manage and evolve a very large mission-critical global codebase, and has halved the ramp-up time for new developers."

The web tech team at Amazon is intent on contributing Mason changes back to the community where possible. For example, about half of the changes in 1.21 and 1.22 (mostly performance improvements) originated at Amazon. See also the MasonPlugins project.

And now the recruiting plug: Amazon.com is seeking experienced Perl and Mason users for full-time web development positions. See http://www.amazon.com/jobs for details.
