===== Adding your components

When you add your own useful components, name them Component:/something/
so that they'll appear in the above list.

Add a space before every line of the source so that they'll format correctly in wiki. 

We're partial towards components that either generate HTML, or provide
something uniquely useful to Mason.  Code that performs general Perl
tasks, like interfacing with a database or validating a credit card
number, probably belongs in a function or module.
