If you want to make your pages slightly more cache-friendly, you need to send a Content-Length header.  Mason's filter sections make this easy
 
 <%filter>
  $r->set_content_length( length $_ );
  </%filter>

If you stick that in an autohandler, all your mason pages will now have a Content-Length header.  Note that you need Apache::File loaded in to get the set_content_length() method on $r.

Unfortunately, this technique doesn't apply if you've turned off mason's buffering.

One other thing to be careful of is UTF-8.  If you've got UTF-8 output in your code somewhere, you'll need to do this:

  <%once>
  use Encode qw( encode_utf8 is_utf8 );
  </%once>
  <%filter>
  # Convert from characters to bytes if necessary.
  $_ = encode_utf8( $_ ) if is_utf8( $_ );
  $r->set_content_length( length $_ );
  </%filter>
