Mason user and fan since the fall of 2000.

I use Mason to run a couple non-profit sites. I wrote
applications for displaying mailing list-archives, maintaining
contact info and event lists, running surveys and a simple
content update mechanism with Wiki-like text to html converter.

Although I find working in Mason delightful and I've implemented
a few small applications I wish there was a mechansim or at
least conventions that make deploying an application easier.
I don't feel comfortable posting my code because it depends
on component/file paths, how I've chosen to arrange my 
component roots, module names, perl load paths, etc. It would
be nice to package everything up into a tar file and have some
installer add it to a Mason component tree automatically ala
Zope. It would make it easier to leverage other peoples code.

Happy hacking.
