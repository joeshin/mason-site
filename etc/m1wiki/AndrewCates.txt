Andrew has kindly been granted admin rights on this wiki so if there is a particular bad spam attack it is worth trying email him as above at catesfamily if you cannot get hold of Dave or Jonathan. You will hit the normal simple spam challenge if you email him but if you are not a robot then it won't be much of a teaser...
