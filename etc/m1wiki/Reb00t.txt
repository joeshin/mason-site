This is a [http://www.perl.org/ Perl] centric [http://www.rpm.org/ RPM] packages repository designed to bring the leverage of better working/maintainance/performance to [http://fedora.redhat.com/ Fedora]/[http://www.redhat.com/ RedHat] Linux Perl programmers and conscious sysadmins.

Unlike rpmpan, cpan2rpm, cpanflute and other tools/repositories like that, Reb00t packages stick to comply with all official [http://www.fedora.us/wiki/QAChecklist QA] policies and guidelines, shifting the /hassle/ from busy sysadmins to the packagers.

Besides the obvious packages for various CPAN modules there are also lots of other worthy pieces of software maintained here, an important example being our heavily crafted edition of [http://www.apache.org/ The Apache Foundation] HTTP Server which bundles [http://httpd.apache.org/ Apache HTTPd] v1.3.x, [http://perl.apache.org/ mod_perl] v1.x, [http://www.modssl.org/ mod_ssl] and [http://httpd.apache.org/apreq/ libapreq] 1.x.
