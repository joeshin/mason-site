Here are the wiki features I want in MasonHQ03.

Must have:

* MasonHQ03WikiComponentCalls
* Really good search that integrates results from wiki, Mason docs, FAQ, and known bugs.

Nice to have:

* MasonHQ03WikiCategorySupport
* Support for HTML tables. Neither CGI::Wiki nor c2.com has tables AFAICT; kwiki does.
