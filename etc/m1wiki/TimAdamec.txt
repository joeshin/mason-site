I've been using HTML::Mason for since early 2001 to develop internal applications for various jobs I've had.

I'm currently developing a very large system in Mason for managing a kiosk network, the customers and their content. This will include interfacing it with SQL Ledger (http://www.sql-ledger.com/) for invoicing and stuff.

Since I have some experience with Mason and absolutely love it as an application development platform, I thought I should start giving back to the Mason community.
