I'm a /Web Engineer/ at [Live365.com http://www.live365.com] "The world's largest internet radio network".  I've been working with Mason since joining Live365 about three years ago.  I enjoy developing & maintaining complex website templating systems (in a past life, I managed the proprietary templating system used to cobrand the [Quicken.com http://www.quicken.com] website), and am fascinated by the ease with which one can build such a website using Mason, specifically with its autohandlers, dhandlers, and OOP mechanisms.
