= Virtual Private Servers =

One appealing Mason option for those who like the idea of administrating their own server is that of Virtual Private Servers:

"[ http://www.webhostingsearch.com/virtual-private-server.php Virtual private servers ] are a means of splitting a single physical server into multiple virtual servers. Virtual private servers are sometimes called virtual dedicated servers. The practice of partitioning a single server so that it appeared as multiple servers was common practice in the days of mainframe computers, but has seen a resurgence lately with the development of software such as User-mode Linux and Xen." 

Any VPS could be used for Mason hosting. Here are some that have listed themselves or been recommended on the mailing list:

[ http://www.bytemark-hosting.co.uk/index.html Bytemark Hosting] doesn't really provide Mason accounts, but instead provides UML (User Mode Linux) virtual machines.  With these virtual machines you get root access to your virtual computer, so you could set up Mason, your choice of SQL,  
etc. I realize that this is akin to me pointing you to a place that does co-location, but there are a couple differences... the biggest of which is that this approach is much cheaper.  I have not tried these guys, or even UML, but have done a lot of work in another virtual machine, VMWare, and can attest to the fact that if they can correctly virtualize the environment, you will be able to do whatever you want on your virtual system.  The only thing to consider is that you are sharing real hardware, so other people's VMs may affect your performance at times.  --GordonMcCreight 10-28-03
